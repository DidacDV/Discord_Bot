# Discord_Bot
Using python and the discord library to create a discord bot.
## Proces
Currently working on this project, mainly using the documentation for the [discord python library](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#discord.Embed.author). While learning this library, i'm also getting into [coroutines and tasks with python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html) (with that not being the main goal).
