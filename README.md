## Process
Currently working on this project, mainly using the documentation for the [discord python library](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#discord.Embed.author). While learning this library, i'm also getting into [coroutines and tasks with python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html) (with that not being the main goal).

## Current Features
- Kei_bot sends an embed when joining a new server, indicates what prefix uses for the commands.
- Using a non blocking API call (doesn't stop the programm execution waiting for the response) with [aiohttp library](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/).
- Using "cogs", a way to group commands and other things.
- Using the youtube_dl library to acces youtube videos through URL or keywords and play their audio.
- Getting latitude/altitude with geopy and using it to get the temperature on a desired city with an API.
