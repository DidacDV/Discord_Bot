# How to set up our bot/app
It's very simple to create a new bot, not its functions, just the bot:
- ### Step 1:
  Go to the [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) and then to the Applications section.

  Having the app created and gong into the bot section, give it a name and if you want customize it more.

- ### Step 2:
  To give our bot **Intents** (which in this context they act like "passes" for the bot to certain events in a server) we have to do it throught the Bot section of our app.

- ### Step 3:
  To use our bot, we will need to get its **TOKEN**, this can be found too at the Bot section. The token will be used in the actual code to run the bot.

- ### Step 4:
  Now, we have to generate an URL that lets us invite the bot to any of our servers. This can be done at the OAuth2 section, selecting the "Bot" scope and giving the
  permissions that we want, we click generate URL and there we have it!
